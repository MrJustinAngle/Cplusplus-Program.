  1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    - This project was to develop an object-oriented programming application that would calculate interest rates and total return over a period of time selected by the user.
  2. What did you do particularly well?
    - I believe I coded this project very well and documented everything I coded with precision.
  3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    - Looking at the code, I am unsure how I could enhance it. I believe it works very well in C++.
  4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    - I found making the list and ensuring the outcome was in the correct rows the hardest to write. I overcame this by ensuring each list had the same amount of characters to ensure it lined up.
  5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    - I think knowing how to make the rows will be very helpful in future coursework where I would need to make lists.
  6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    - I explained each line of code I wrote and what is does and kept to the industry standard coding. This will allow any programmer to update the code if needed.
